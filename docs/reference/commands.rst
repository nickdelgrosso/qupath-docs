Commands

.. contents:: :local:
  :depth: 1

File
====

Create project
--------------
*File → Project... → Create project*

Create a new project. Usually it's easier just to drag an empty folder onto QuPath to create a project, rather than navigate these menus.

Open project
------------
*File → Project... → Open project*

Open an existing project. Usually it's easier just to drag a project folder onto QuPath to open it, rather than bother with this command.

Close project
-------------
*File → Project... → Close project*

Close the current project, including any images that are open.

Add images
----------
*File → Project... → Add images*

Add images to the current project. You can also add images by dragging files onto the main QuPath window.

Export image list
-----------------
*File → Project... → Export image list*

Export a list of the image paths for images in the current project.

Edit project metadata
---------------------
*File → Project... → Edit project metadata*

Edit the metadata for the current project. By adding key-value properties to images, they can be sorted and queried more easily.

Check project URIs
------------------
*File → Project... → Check project URIs*

Check the 'Uniform Resource Identifiers' for images in the current project. This basically helps fix things whenever files have moved and images can no longer be found.

Import images from v0.1.2
-------------------------
*File → Project... → Import images from v0.1.2*

Import images from a legacy project (QuPath v0.1.2 or earlier).

Note that it is generally a bad idea to mix versions of QuPath for analysis, but this can be helpful to recover old data and annotations.

The original images will need to be available, with the paths set correctly in the project file.

Open...
-------
*File → Open...*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+O`

Open an image in the current viewer, using a file chooser. You can also just drag the file on top of the viewer.

Open URI...
-----------
*File → Open URI...*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+O`

Open an image in the current viewer, by entering the path to the image. This can be used to add images that are not represented by local files (e.g. hosted by OMERO), but beware that a compatible image reader needs to be available to interpret them.

Reload data
-----------
*File → Reload data*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+R`

Reload any previously-saved data for the current image. This provides a more dramatic form of 'undo' (albeit without any 'redo' option).

Save As
-------
*File → Save As*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+S`

Save a .qpdata file for this image, specifying the file path. Warning! It is usually much better to use projects instead, and allow QuPath to decide where to store your data files.

Save
----
*File → Save*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+S`

Save a .qpdata file for this image. This command is best used within projects, where QuPath will choose the location to save the file.

Original pixels
---------------
*File → Export images... → Original pixels*

Export an image region, by extracting the pixels from the original image.

Rendered RGB (with overlays)
----------------------------
*File → Export images... → Rendered RGB (with overlays)*

Export an image region, as an RGB image matching how it is displayed in the viewer.

OME TIFF
--------
*File → Export images... → OME TIFF*

Write regions as OME-TIFF images. This supports writing image pyramids.

Rendered SVG
------------
*File → Export images... → Rendered SVG*

Export the current selected region as a rendered (RGB) SVG image. Any annotations and ROIs will be stored as vectors, which can later be adjusted in other software.

Main window screenshot
----------------------
*File → Export snapshot... → Main window screenshot*

Export the area of the screen corresponding to the main QuPath window to the clipboard. This includes any additional overlapping windows and dialog boxes.

Main window content
-------------------
*File → Export snapshot... → Main window content*

Export the contents of the main QuPath window to the clipboard. This ignores any additional overlapping windows and dialog boxes.

Current viewer content
----------------------
*File → Export snapshot... → Current viewer content*

Export the contents of the current viewer to the clipboard. Note that this creates an RGB image, which does not necessarily contain the original pixel values.

Current viewer content (SVG)
----------------------------
*File → Export snapshot... → Current viewer content (SVG)*

Export an RGB snapshot of the current viewer content as an SVG image. Any annotations and ROIs will be stored as vectors, which can later be adjusted in other software.

Import TMA map
--------------
*File → TMA data... → Import TMA map*

Import a TMA map, e.g. a grid containing 'Unique ID' values for each core.

Export TMA data
---------------
*File → TMA data... → Export TMA data*

Export TMA data for the current image, in a format compatible with the 'TMA data viewer'.

Launch TMA data viewer
----------------------
*File → TMA data... → Launch TMA data viewer*

Launch the 'TMA data viewer' to visualize TMA core data that was previously exported.

Quit
----
*File → Quit*

Quit QuPath.

Edit
====

Undo
----
*Edit → Undo*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+Z`

Undo the last action for the current viewer. Note QuPath's undo is limited, and turns itself off (for performance reasons) when many objects are present. The limit can be adjusted in the preferences.

Redo
----
*Edit → Redo*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+Z`

Redo the last action for the current viewer.

Current viewer
--------------
*Edit → Copy to clipboard... → Current viewer*  - :kbd:`Ctrl+C`

Main window content
-------------------
*Edit → Copy to clipboard... → Main window content*

Copy the contents of the main QuPath window to the clipboard. This ignores any additional overlapping windows and dialog boxes.

Main window screenshot
----------------------
*Edit → Copy to clipboard... → Main window screenshot*

Copy the area of the screen corresponding to the main QuPath window to the clipboard. This includes any additional overlapping windows and dialog boxes.

Full screenshot

It is essential to set the image type first (e.g. brightfield or fluorescence) before running this command.

Positive cell detection
-----------------------
*Analyze → Cell detection → Positive cell detection*

Equivalent to 'Cell detection', with additional parameters to set a threshold during detection to identify single-positive cells.

Subcellular detection (experimental)
------------------------------------
*Analyze → Cell detection → Subcellular detection (experimental)*

Identify subcellular structures (e.g. spots of all kinds) within detected cells.

Add new shape-based features to objects.

Distance to annotations 2D
--------------------------

Detect centroid distances 2D
----------------------------
*Analyze → Spatial analysis → Detect centroid distances 2D*

Calculate distances between detection centroids for each classification. For example, this may be used to identify the closest cell of a specified type.

Delaunay cluster features 2D
----------------------------
*Analyze → Spatial analysis → Delaunay cluster features 2D*

Apply a Delaunay triangulation to detection objects based on their centroid locations. This helps identify clusters of objects neighboring one another.

Note this command is likely to be replaced in a future version.

Interactive image alignment
---------------------------

Experimental command to interactively align images using an Affine transform. This is currently not terribly useful in itself, but may be helpful as part of more complex scripting workflows.

Positive pixel count (deprecated)
---------------------------------
*Analyze → Deprecated → Positive pixel count (deprecated)*

Area-based quantification of positive pixels with DAB staining. This command does not handle large regions well; if possible, pixel classification should usually be used instead.

Simple tissue detection (deprecated)
------------------------------------
*Analyze → Deprecated → Simple tissue detection (deprecated)*

Detect large regions using a simple thresholding method. This command is not very flexible and lacks any preview of the results; if possible, pixel classification should usually be used instead.

Cell + membrane detection (deprecated)
--------------------------------------
*Analyze → Deprecated → Cell + membrane detection (deprecated)*

Cell detection that uses membrane information to constrain cell boundary expansion. 

This was designed specifically for hematoxylin and DAB staining, and works only where membrane staining is either very clear or absent. It is not recommended in general.

This is being replaced by a new and more flexible approach to object classification.

This can be used to train separate classifiers for different channels in multiplexed images, which are then merged to form a composite classifier.
